\section{Mantle Brains: Tools We Plug In to Detect ``when"}

Requirements: run online, be fast enough to run as often as we want to detect
regimes

\subsection{System Specific Knowledge}

{\it e.g.}, request rate, unique keys in a sliding window, bandwidth
capabilties. For example, we know that LevelDB cannot handle high IO request
rates.

\subsubsection{Request Rate}

\subsubsection{Belady's Min}

\subsection{Domain Specific Knowledge}

{\it e.g.}, ParSplice key access locality.

\subsubsection{Regime Detection}
\subsubsection{Trajectory Length}

\subsection{Failed, Overcomplicated Brains}
These techniques proliferated more, less transparent knobs
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statistics
  \item Calculus
  \item K-Means
  \item DBScan
  \item Anomaly Detection
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cloud Techniques: Elastic Search}

What if we re-provision resources in response to events outside the
application's control, such as a slow Lustre.

\subsection{Future work}

How Much: cache policy from past, regime detection
