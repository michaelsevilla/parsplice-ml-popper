\section{Mantle Brains: Tools We Plug In}

Requirements: run online, be fast enough to run as often as we want to detect
regimes

\subsection{Failed, Overcomplicated Brains}
These techniques proliferated more, less transparent knobs
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statistics
  \item Calculus
  \item K-Means
  \item DBScan
  \item Anomaly Detection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Specific Knowledge}

We tried looking at system-specific metrics to design policies, like request
rate, unique keys in a sliding window, bandwidth capabilties. For example, we
know that LevelDB cannot handle high IO request rates.

\subsubsection{when: request rate}

\subsubsection{when: Belady's Min}

\subsection{Domain Specific Knowledge}

We tried looking at domain-specific metrics to design policies, like ParSplice
key access locality.

\subsubsection{howmuch: regime detection}
\subsubsection{when: trajectory length goodness}
\subsubsection{howmuch: cache policy from past}

\subsection{Cloud Techniques: Elastic Search}

What if we re-provision resource in response to events outside the
application's control, such as a slow Lustre.
